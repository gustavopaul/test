            <p class="parrafo">The reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year had an eight-game sack streak and a
                pick-six last season, despite
                many holds against him going uncalled. Perhaps Mack will start getting those calls now that he’s been
                named
                a first-team All-Pro in consecutive seasons (26 sacks and seven forced fumbles since 2015).

            <p class="parrafo">No NFL player in history has averaged more scrimmage yards per game through four seasons
                than Bell’s 128.7. And
                his 157 yards per game last year ranks third all-time for a running back in a season. Bell can function
                as
                both a No. 2 receiver (6.3 catches per game in 2016) and a bell-cow back (1,172 rushing yards on 220
                carries
                over his final eight games last season).

            <p class="parrafo">Beckham is the only receiver in NFL history to record at least 80 catches, 1,300 yards
                and 10 or more touchdowns
                in each of his first three professional seasons. Brandon Marshall set the bar high for his new
                teammate,
                saying, “Odell is probably the best player in the NFL. ... He’s not even a superstar, he’s a rock
                star.”
